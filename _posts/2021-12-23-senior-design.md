Senior Design is a graduation requirement for University of Pennsylvania undergraduate engineering students. Senior Design is a capstone project where students have the opportunity to work in teams of 3-6 to build a product, explore a research topic, or some fusion of these two. The project spans one calendar year and culminates in two main final demonstrations. One demonstration occurs at the end of the fall semester where teams present the progress that they've made in the past semester as well as their plans for the coming semester. The other demonstration occurs at the end of the spring semester and lets students present a short demonstration of their work from the past calendar year. Senior Design is offered by each department such that teams can be formed only of students majoring in that department.  There is also an interdepartmental offering, which removes restrictions on team composition.

My team, Boomboat, is an interdepartmental senior design team comprised of students with backgrounds in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, and Robotics.  We are housed in the Electical and Systems Engineering (ESE) department, where [Dr. Sid Deliwala](https://detkin.ese.upenn.edu/team/sid-deliwala/) and [Dr. Jan Van Der Spiegel](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jan/) serve as instructors and field experts.  We are advised by [Dr. Pratik Chaudhari](https://pratikac.github.io), and work very closely with [Dr. Ani Hsieh](https://scalar.seas.upenn.edu/).  With the help of these industry and field experts, we hope that we can make Boomboat into an impactful robotics solution to a highly relevant and important problem.
